                    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">FaceTime Upgrades:</p>
                    <p>One of the standout features of iOS 15 is the significant enhancements made to FaceTime. Spatial Audio, Voice Isolation, and Wide Spectrum Audio make conversations feel more natural and immersive. FaceTime calls can now be scheduled and shared via links, enabling users to create planned virtual gatherings effortlessly. The addition of FaceTime on Android and Windows through web links marks a major step towards inclusivity, allowing users across different platforms to join FaceTime calls.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Focus Mode:</p>
                    <p>With the increasing number of notifications and constant connectivity, maintaining focus has become a challenge. iOS 15 introduces Focus Mode, allowing users to customize notification preferences based on their current activity or location. Whether you're working, sleeping, or engaging in a specific task, Focus Mode helps reduce distractions and ensures that only the most important notifications reach you.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Live Text and Visual Lookup:</p>
                    <p>Live Text is a powerful new feature that uses on-device intelligence to recognize and interact with text in photos. Users can copy, paste, look up, or translate text directly from the camera or photos app. Visual Lookup takes image recognition further by allowing users to learn more about objects and scenes within photos by simply tapping on them. This feature adds a new layer of interactivity and utility to the iPhone's camera capabilities.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Safari Redesign:</p>
                    <p>iOS 15 brings a refreshed design to the Safari browser, making it more intuitive and user-friendly. The address bar is now at the bottom of the screen, allowing for easier one-handed navigation. Tab Groups help users organize their open tabs, and a new collaborative browsing feature enables users to share entire tab collections with others, fostering seamless collaboration.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Maps Enhancements:</p>
                    <p>Apple Maps receives a substantial upgrade in iOS 15, offering more detailed maps and improved navigation. New features include immersive 3D city experiences, road details like turn lanes and medians, and enhanced transit directions. Maps also introduces a new augmented reality walking experience, providing users with detailed directions in real time through the iPhone's camera.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Weather App Redesign:</p>
                    <p>The Weather app gets a redesign, featuring more dynamic and animated weather representations. Full-screen maps, new layouts, and graphical displays of weather conditions provide users with a richer and more visually engaging experience when checking the forecast.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Conclusion:</p>
                    <p>iOS 15 builds upon the solid foundation of its predecessors, introducing a host of features designed to enhance user experience, productivity, and connectivity. From FaceTime improvements to the introduction of Live Text and Focus Mode, Apple continues to prioritize innovation and user-centric design in its operating systems. As users explore and adapt to the latest iOS, it's clear that iOS 15 is not just an update but a significant step forward in shaping the future of mobile operating systems.</p>
